\section{Conclusion}
As seen in figure~\ref{fig:coveredsphere} and discussed in~\subsectionref{Is the sphere covered?} and in \chapterref{cha:discussion} it seems that the whole sphere is covered by these inequalities when the restriction of real coefficients is applied to the states.  

\section{Further research to be done}
\subsection{Calculating with complex coefficients}
By removing the requirement that all states only should have real coefficients would open up a whole new world. One would unfortunately lose the simple visualization, as was preferred in this thesis, however it would give the full set of states that exist. This would not require much more than was done in this thesis, simply recalculate the inequalities with complex coefficients and then in some way try to visualize if this covers the full set of states. 
\subsection{Other spin systems}
As discussed previously, mostly spin $\frac{1}{2}$ systems are of interest and in this thesis spin 1 systems were discussed. However there exists a whole range of spin systems, almost all half integers and all integers have their own spin system in nature. Is there any schema that can include these? This is an interesting question that could be seen as further research from this thesis.
